Let $G$ be a simple $n$-vertex graph and $c$ be a colouring
of $E(G)$ with $n$ colours, where each colour class has size at least
$2$. We prove that $G$ contains a rainbow cycle of length at most
$\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$, which is best possible. Our result
settles a special case of a strengthening of the Caccetta-HÃ¤ggkvist
conjecture, due to Aharoni. We also show that the matroid
generalization of our main result also holds for cographic matroids,
but fails for binary matroids.

This is joint work with Matt DeVos, Krystal Guo, Daryl Funk, Bojan
Mohar, and Amanda Montejano.
