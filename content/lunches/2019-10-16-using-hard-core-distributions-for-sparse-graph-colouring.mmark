Writing $$\mathcal{I}(G)$$ for the collection of independent sets of a given
graph $$G$$, a random independent set $$\mathcal{B}$$ drawn according to the
hard-core distribution at fugacity $$\lambda$$ on $$\mathcal{I}(G)$$ satisfies for
every independent set $$I\in \mathcal{I}(G)$$ that $$\Pr[\mathcal{B} = I] =
\frac{\lambda^{|I|}}{Z_\lambda(G)}$$, where $$Z_\lambda(G) = \sum_{I\in
\mathcal{I}(G)} \lambda^{|I|}$$ is a normalising factor, called the independence
polynomial of $$G$$.

Inspired by a method of Molloy and Reed which demonstrates a fractional version
of Reed's conjecture, namely $$\chi_f(G) \le (\omega(G)+\Delta(G)+1)/2$$ for
every graph $$G$$, we show that a greedy fractional colouring algorithm is really
efficient in order to return a fractional colouring of various classes of
sparse graphs, when used with the hard-core distribution on independent sets.
